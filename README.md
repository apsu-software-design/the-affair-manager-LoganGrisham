# The Affair Manager

This repo contains code for a command-line application to manage events (called "affairs" in the code), created as part of an assignment for CSCI 4602 at Austin Peay State University.

The below questions should be answered _in detail_ regarding your submission!

##### Reflect on how you determined the architecture of your application. What process did you use to determine which classes to define? #####
> I spend a day just reading it over and designing it, then I realized I needed to make it fit to the UI. So I created the classes for each object then had it primarily all controlled by the manager. 


##### Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> All the questions I asked to classmates where how to get it to compile which was stressful for an idiot, such as I. Besides that it was mostly guessing and reading microsofts official documentation.


##### Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> ~9 (but it's not complete)


##### On a scale of 1 (too easy) to 10 (too challenging), how difficult was this assignment? #####
> 10. I am basing this on several aspects. I'm not upset at this assignment or the concepts in it. 
I say that it is too challenging based on the transition to a new language mostly, as I don't know how to convey OOP and SOLID and all the proper principles, 
since I don't fundametaly understand the language. I do not wholly blame this on the assignemnt, again, I just had to do alot of reading and don't think I could learn
it all in just a few days and properly implement it at the level that was expected.


##### Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> No linux. Maybe also consider not doing it in typescript. I understand the exposure is important, but the full transition was abrupt, and I have not actually learned anything. In the future,
to mitigate this since typescript isn't going anywhere, entertain more assignments inbetween to allow students to learn typescript in less exponential leaps. The workload was not the issue at all, 
and more assignments is not unreasaonable.
